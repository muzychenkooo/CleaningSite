description: Visual and content parity with bigyborka.ru — mirror reference structure and content, modernize UI/UX
alwaysApply: true
---

========================
VISUAL + CONTENT PARITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
========================

Target reference (the site to mirror): `https://bigyborka.ru/`

GOAL:
Build a site that is **pixel-close and content-identical in structure** to the reference, but **modernized**. The finished product must feel like "the same site, same brand, same offers", just upgraded for 2026.

HARD REQUIREMENTS:
1) **Pixel-close parity**:
   - Mirror the reference site's information architecture, page list, section order, layout composition, and component types.
   - Keep the same navigation items, anchors, and the same "what goes where" on every page/section.
   - Match spacing, rhythm, and visual hierarchy closely (typography scale can be improved, but proportions must remain recognizable).

2) **Brand fidelity**:
   - Preserve corporate colors (primary/secondary/accent), typography vibe, icon style direction, and overall tone.
   - Preserve all texts, UTPs, offers, pricing blocks, guarantees, and CTA labels in meaning. Rephrase only if it improves clarity, but do not change claims.

3) **Modernize everything (without changing what it is)**:
   - Upgrade UI polish (better grid, consistent components, modern buttons/cards, improved mobile).
   - Upgrade UX (sticky mobile CTA, better forms, clearer calculator, better feedback states).
   - Upgrade accessibility, performance, SEO, and code quality.

4) **No "creative redesign"**:
   - Do NOT invent new sections, remove existing sections, or reorder major blocks.
   - Do NOT change the product positioning or marketing message.
   - Do NOT swap the layout concept; only refine and modernize within the same structure.

5) **Exact content coverage**:
   - If a page/section exists on `https://bigyborka.ru/`, it must exist in the rebuilt site, upgraded.
   - No placeholders, no missing pages, no broken links.

IMPLEMENTATION METHOD (MANDATORY):
- During discovery, open the reference site and create a **parity checklist**: pages → sections → key elements (headline, bullets, CTAs, forms, pricing, FAQ, contacts).
- Implement each page by checking off items until the page is fully matched + improved.
- Validate responsiveness for the same breakpoints as the reference (mobile/tablet/desktop).
- Preserve routing/URL structure where possible; add redirects if changed.

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- A user familiar with `https://bigyborka.ru/` says: "Это тот же сайт, только намного современнее, быстрее и удобнее", and can find every section in the same place.

========================================
QUIZ (NOT CALCULATOR) — PRIMARY CTA REWORK
========================================

The primary CTA must NOT be "calculator-style cost estimate". It must be a **multi-step quiz** (квиз) that feels premium and drives conversions.

GOAL:
Replace the current "Рассчитать стоимость/цену" flow with a **high-quality quiz** that:
- increases lead conversion,
- feels like a product (premium UI, smooth steps),
- still preserves the business meaning from the reference site `https://bigyborka.ru/` (don't invent claims),
- outputs a clear "result" screen + lead capture.

HARD REQUIREMENTS:
1) **Kviz UX (multi-step)**
   - 5–8 steps max, each step simple and fast.
   - Stepper with progress (e.g. "Шаг 2 из 6"), plus back button.
   - Autosave selections between steps.
   - Instant validation + helpful microcopy.

2) **Lead capture is part of the flow**
   - Final step collects: name + phone (+ optional address/time).
   - Add consent checkbox text if required by RU practice (do not invent legal text; reuse/derive from existing legal blocks).
   - Show success screen with next steps ("Менеджер свяжется…") and a clear CTA.

3) **Questions must match cleaning domain and the reference offer**
   Build the quiz questions based on what exists on `https://bigyborka.ru/` services/price logic and wording.
   If exact logic is unclear, infer minimally from the site structure and keep it configurable.

   Recommended steps (adapt to reference):
   - Step 1: Тип уборки (Квартира / Дом / Офис / После ремонта / Мойка окон)
   - Step 2: Площадь (slider or input with presets)
   - Step 3: Кол-во комнат / санузлов (if relevant)
   - Step 4: Доп. услуги (checkbox grid: холодильник, духовка, балкон и т.д. — only if these exist on reference)
   - Step 5: Срочность / дата-время (optional)
   - Step 6: Контакты (имя/телефон) + согласие

4) **Result screen**
   - Present either:
     - "Ориентировочная стоимость: …" (if you have a safe formula), OR
     - "Подготовим точную смету за 5–10 минут" + show selected parameters
   - Do NOT invent numbers. If formulas/data exist in repo or on reference site — use them. Otherwise show a range or "уточним по телефону".

5) **Premium UI**
   - Wide layout (matches global `Container` width).
   - Two-column on desktop:
     - left: steps/questions
     - right: sticky "summary card" with chosen params + trust badges
   - Mobile: single column, sticky bottom "Далее" button.
   - Strong visuals: cards, icons, subtle shadows, clean spacing.
   - Animations: step transitions (fade/slide), button press, focus rings.
   - Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

6) **Reliability + a11y**
   - Keyboard accessible, proper labels/aria.
   - No layout shifts when switching steps.
   - Form validation with clear messages.
   - No overlapping text anywhere.

7) **Integration**
   - The CTA buttons in header/hero ("Рассчитать цену/стоимость") must open the quiz:
     - Desktop: modal dialog OR dedicated `/quiz` page (prefer `/quiz` for SEO + shareable link)
     - Mobile: full-screen Drawer/Sheet or page route
   - Add analytics hooks (events) but don't hardcode IDs unless present.
   - Anti-spam: honeypot + time-based submit guard; add rate limit if server exists.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (MANDATORY):
- Centralize quiz config in one place (so it's editable):
  - `data/quiz.ts` for steps/options/microcopy
  - `lib/quiz/*` for validation + (optional) price/range logic
- UI components:
  - `components/quiz/QuizWizard`
  - `components/quiz/QuizStep*`
  - `components/quiz/QuizSummaryCard`
- Ensure quiz uses the same width system and design tokens as the site.

DEFINITION OF DONE:
- The primary CTA opens a premium multi-step quiz (not a calculator form).
- The quiz is stable, responsive, accessible, and "wow".
- No overlaps/clipping.
- Lead submission flow works end-to-end with success state.
